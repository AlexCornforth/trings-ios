# Trings iOS

## Project Details

This is the iOS app for the Trings open source project (www.treetracker.org).
This project coordinates tree planting employment for people living in extreme poverty.
The iOS segment allows people to track and verify reforestation plantings,
paying planters on a per planting basis.

This app is a wallet for managing tokens earned by growing trees.

## Project Setup

### Bundler
This project uses bundler (https://bundler.io/) to manage cocoapods, fastlane and CocoapodsKeys. Use `bundle exec` when using these dependencies.

Install with `gem install bundler`

Run `bundle install` to install cocoapods, fastlane and CocoapodsKeys.

### CocoaPods
Dependencies are managed using [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/) and are checked into to repository.
Even though we check in the dependencies you will need to install CocoaPods to run the project as we use a plugin called CocoapodsKeys.

## Deployment
